# ModuPlane Pro

**ModuPlane Pro** is an advanced **Unity Input & UI Framework** designed for **mode-less simultaneous interaction**. It seamlessly bridges the gap between First-Person character control and complex World-Space/Screen-Space UI manipulation, allowing users to control a character with a joystick/keyboard while simultaneously interacting with UI elements using a mouse.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Mode-less Interaction**: Control your character (WASD/Joystick) and interaction with UI (Mouse) at the same time without state switching.
*   **Hybrid UI System**:
    *   **World-Space UI**: Buttons exist physically in the 3D world on a plane.
    *   **Screen-Space UI**: Overlay buttons that stick to screen edges (responsive to window resizing).
*   **Advanced Interaction**:
    *   **Drag & Drop**: Move buttons and the world plane itself.
    *   **Resize & Rotate**: Resize buttons via corners or scroll wheel; rotate with right-click drag.
    *   **Grid Snapping**: Hold `SHIFT` for precise adjustments.
*   **Dual Input Support**: Additive input combines Keyboard (WASD/QE) and Joystick (Analog Stick/Twist) for 100% control authority.
*   **Procedural Generation**: logic-driven environment and UI creation for maximum flexibility.

## 📦 Requirements

*   **Unity 6.3.2 LTS** (HDRP) or higher.
*   **Input System Package** (Active).
*   **UI Toolkit** (Built-in).
